Brief description of the application and how the work will be partitioned between the emulator and application:

Justification for using GitHub (Callum):
For our version control system, we decided to use GitHub. The main reasoning here was that some of us already had experience with
GitHub, which makes teaching the other members a lot easier than everyone on the team trying to learn a new system. GitHub
also offers a series of features that make it a good choice version control system for this project, including the ability to
control which collaborators can access the repositiory, the ability for users to edit the files from anywhere, automatic
changelog creation and the fact that it is widely used in industry, meaning that learning it now puts us at an advantage for
when we move into employment.

Why we chose to use Dart for our JavaScript (Hussein):

Nowadays there are a multitude of languages for JavaScript development. After a bit
of searching, we decided to choose Dart over other languages because our group is
confortable with it for the benefits it has in our case.

If we are starting a new web app, considering Dart suitable choice for our
application.  It’s a very clean, modern language with extensive libraries out-of-the
box.  However, our application must also run on smart-watch browsers, and
interface properly with our native code.  If we later find out that Dart code doesn’t
run properly or fast enough on the devices, we may be at a dead end.  This is a risk
we don’t want to take.

Dart is a broadly useful programming language that is implied for front-end Web
development, but can also be used to make numerous different sorts of applications.
It compiles directly to JavaScript, so it can be used across all browsers and arguably,
it fixes a lot of the problems that JavaScript has.



Why we chose to use Eclipse for our Editor (James):

It was originally decided to use Eclipse as our JavaScript IDE however on further investigation into Reddit forums and review 
sites, no one seems to recommend Eclipse for JavaScript. It's many faults include incorrect code diagnostics and a lack of code 
folding with very slow startup. I then looked into Webstorm as an alternative, which I think we should try as it is recommended
highly. However it does seem like it might have a steep learning curve. Netbeans may be the best option for us at this time as 
some of us already have experience with it.

Why we chose to use FireBug for our debugging (Yousef):

The debugging tool that we aim to use for our debugging is Firebug.
Firebug integrates with Firefox to put a wealth of web development tools at your fingertips while you brrowse.
The reason we chose Firebug is because it allows us to edit, debug, and monitor CSS, HTML and JavaScript live in any web page.
Also and more importantly it quickly finds the errors when things go wrong and immediately gives you detailed and useful information about 
the errors in JavaScript, CSS, and XML. In addition, Firebug has a better and cleaner interface for editing HTML and CSS over Chrome.
