Justification for using GitHub (Callum);


Why we chose to use Dart for our JavaScript (Hussein);


Why we chose to use Eclipse for our Editor (James);

It was originally decided to use Eclipse as our JavaScript IDE however on further investigation into Reddit forums and review 
sites, no one seems to recommend Eclipse for JavaScript. It's many faults include incorrect code diagnostics and a lack of code 
folding with very slow startup. I then looked into Webstorm as an alternative, which I think we should try as it is recommended
highly. However it does seem like it might have a steep learning curve. Netbeans may be the best option for us at this time as 
some of us already have experience with it.

Why we chose to use FireBug for our debugging (Yosef);

The debugging tool that we aim to use for our debugging is Firebug.
Firebug integrates with Firefox to put a wealth of web development tools at your fingertips while you brrowse.
The reason we chose Firebug is because it allows us to edit, debug, and monitor CSS, HTML and JavaScript live in any web page.
Also and more importantly it quickly finds the errors when things go wrong and immediately gives you detailed and useful information about the errors in JavaScript, CSS, and XML. In addition, Firebug has a better and cleaner interface for editing HTML and CSS over Chrome.
